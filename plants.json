    Curcumin helps to fight oxidative damage and boosting the body's own antioxidant enzymes.
    This is important, because oxidative damage is believed to be one of the key mechanisms
    behind ageing and many diseases. Curcumin is also strongly anti-inflammatory, to the point
    where it matches the effectiveness of some anti-inflammatory drugs. Studies suggest that
    it can improve brain function, fight Alzheimer's, reduce the risk of heart disease and
    cancer, and relieve arthritis, to name a few "
